      <h2>Understanding Basic Finance</h2>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Budgeting</h3>
        <p>Budgeting is the foundation of good financial management. It involves planning how to allocate income to cover necessary expenses, savings, and discretionary spending.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using budgeting apps or templates to track monthly income and expenses and avoid overspending.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Saving</h3>
        <p>Saving means consistently putting aside part of your income for future use, such as emergencies, large purchases, or investments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Opening a high-yield savings account to build an emergency fund.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Emergency Funds</h3>
        <p>An emergency fund is a financial safety net that covers unexpected expenses like medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent repairs.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Aim to save 3–6 months’ worth of living expenses in a separate account.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Investing</h3>
        <p>Investing helps your money grow over time. It includes putting money into assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Starting with a diversified index fund to reduce risk while earning steady returns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Retirement Planning</h3>
        <p>Planning for retirement involves setting long-term savings goals and choosing suitable retirement accounts or investment options.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start early to take advantage of compound interest over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Debt Management</h3>
        <p>Debt management strategies help reduce the burden of loans or credit card balances by prioritizing repayment and avoiding unnecessary borrowing.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the debt snowball or avalanche method to pay off outstanding loans systematically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Credit Scores</h3>
        <p>A credit score reflects your creditworthiness and is used by lenders to evaluate loan applications. Timely repayments and low credit utilization help maintain a healthy score.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Monitor your credit report regularly and dispute any inaccuracies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="basic-concept">
        <h3>Financial Literacy</h3>
        <p>Financial literacy means understanding key financial principles, such as how interest works, how to manage credit, and how to make informed financial decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Resources:</strong> Online courses, books, podcasts, and local workshops can enhance your knowledge and confidence in managing money.</p>
